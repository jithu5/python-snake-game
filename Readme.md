# Snake Game

**This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using Python's turtle module. The game involves controlling a snake to eat food, grow in size, and avoid collisions with the walls and its own tail.**

## Files

- main.py: The main entry point of the game. It sets up the game screen, initializes the snake, food, and scoreboard, and contains the game loop.
- snake.py: Contains the Snake class, which manages the snake's segments, movement, and direction controls.
- food.py: Contains the Food class, which manages the food's appearance and random positioning on the screen.
- score_board.py: Contains the Scoreboard class, which manages the score display and game over message.
